# 1a. "Hello world"

Welcome to GSA ULTRA. Consider this the easy problem to see how it all works!

For this problem we would like you to write a function that takes an integer `a`
and an integer `b` and adds them together.

To write your function, simply fill in the function stub in the editor. Only
Python 2.7.9 or Python 3.4.2 code is accepted.

Please do not change the function signature or your answer will not be accepted!

The entry into the crossword will be the return value of your function when it
is called automatically with inputs `5432` and `3333`. This value must be output
using the `return` keyword - messages printed to the console via the `print`
keyword will be ignored. You do not need to worry about providing the specific
inputs to the problems - code your function in a general sense and we'll handle
the rest.

You can run your code as many times as you like using the "Run" button. Clicking
the "Save" button will run your code once more and save the result into the
crossword. You will see a visual notification if the values of any cells in your
output collide with intersecting values that are already in the crossword. It
will also save your source code so that you can come back to it later. You can
revisit a question and change both your code and the result it produces as many
times as you like before you submit your entire crossword for review.
